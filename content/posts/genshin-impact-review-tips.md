Cassio's here. Yesterday I downloaded Genshin Impact because of my brother and the online hype. After playing it for a few hours I'm here to share my opinion with you.

## The Game

Genshin Impact is a sandbox rpg game. Well, it sounds really simple but miHoYo (developer) did an amazing work!

If you are used to play online rpg the story will not surprise you. But what will surprise you is how it seems that each character is alive and how the scenes and dub is well made.

Now I'm going to make a short review on gameplay, plot and characters, if you are thinking of playing the game check the begginers tip on the end of the article.

### Gameplay 9/10

The game is not that hard and have some really cool mechanics, the only problem is that if you want to play it right you will have to read and think a little.

Notable cool mechanincs are:

 - Elemental Reactions
 - Elemental Resonance
 - Character Switching
 - Team Building

### Plot 7/10

As said, the plot is not the masterpiece. What makes the game awesome is how they adapt this plot into the game. Paimon is so funny and adorable that you would want one too.

### Characters 10/10

This is what makes the game amazing! There are a lot of dubbed dialogues and monologues each of them make the character alive. Not only that, but their moviments are really fluid and natural too. I doubt you won't like any character.
