Cassio's Here. Last week I visited my grandma's house, and tried to play minecraft in a old computer. I had some issues with RAM and I couldn't install much mods, so I'll write a little about how to optimize minecraft (you can use it in other java games) so that it runs smoothly in your PC.

## Arguments

Here I'll just share all the arguments for **JRE 1.8.0_261**, if you want you can read futher for explanation and reference. You can install the 64 bits version with this [link](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

If you have any problem feel free to contact me.

### Default args

You should check minecraft default args first.

```bash
-Xmx1G -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy -Xmn128M
```

## Tenelia Arguments

These are not made by me, but I got from [here](https://xealgaming.net/threads/optimising-your-minecraft-jvm-arguments.4758/).

```

## Arguments Guide

All descriptions that are blockquoted are from Oracle docs, you can check the reference at the end.

Values with ```<var>``` label must be defined manualy.

The line below shows the 3 most know JVM arguments.

```bash
-Xms<var> -Xmx<var> -Xmn<var>
```

### Xms

The start memory.

> Setting initial and minimum heap size
> 
> Oracle recommends setting the minimum heap size `-Xms` equal to the maximum heap size `-Xmx` to minimize garbage collections.

### Xms

The max memory GC will use.

> Setting maximum heap size
> 
> Setting a low maximum heap value compared to the amount of live data decrease performance by forcing frequent garbage collections.

### Xmn

> Minimum java heap size.
>  
>  Oracle recommends that `-Xmn` and `-Xmx` be set to the same value. This eliminates potentially costly heap reallocations, and can reduce the amount of heap fragmentation that can occur. Setting `-Xms` is then unnecessary since the heap size itself is static.


## Advanced JVM args

```bash
-XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -XX:+UseCompressedOops -XX:-UsePerfData
```

### AggressiveHeap

> Enables Java heap optimization. This sets various parameters to be optimal for long-running jobs with intensive memory allocation, based on the configuration of the computer (RAM and CPU). By default, the option is disabled and the heap is not optimized.

---

### AggressiveOpts

> Enables the use of aggressive performance optimization features, which are expected to become default in upcoming releases. By default, this option is disabled and experimental performance features are not used.

---

### AlwaysPreTouch

> Enables touching of every page on the Java heap during JVM initialization. This gets all pages into the memory before entering the  `main()`  method. The option can be used in testing to simulate a long-running system with all virtual memory mapped to physical memory. By default, this option is disabled and all pages are committed as JVM heap space fills.

---

### DisableExplicitGC

> Another way that applications can interact with garbage collection is by invoking full garbage collections explicitly by calling  `System.gc()`. This can force a major collection to be done when it may not be necessary (for example, when a minor collection would suffice), and so in general should be avoided. The performance effect of explicit garbage collections can be measured by disabling them using the flag  `-XX:+DisableExplicitGC`, which causes the VM to ignore calls to  `System.gc()`.

---

### ParallelRefProcEnabled

> Enables parallel reference processing. By default, this option is disabled.

---

### PerfDisableSharedMem 

I didn't find an official doc, but it seems that this prevent GC from writing in the file system.

---

### UsePerfData

> Enables the `perfdata` feature. This option is enabled by default to allow JVM monitoring and performance testing. Disabling it suppresses the creation of the `hsperfdata_userid` directories. To disable the `perfdata` feature, specify `-XX:-UsePerfData`.

---

### UseCompressedOops

> Disables the use of compressed pointers. By default, this option is enabled, and compressed pointers are used when Java heap sizes are less than 32 GB. When this option is enabled, object references are represented as 32-bit offsets instead of 64-bit pointers, which typically increases performance when running the application with Java heap sizes less than 32 GB. This option works only for 64-bit JVMs.

---

## Garbage Colectors

Java **JRE 1.8.0_261** have these garbage colectors:

 - Serial Garbage Colector:

> The serial collector uses a single thread to perform all garbage collection work, which makes it relatively efficient because there is no communication overhead between threads. It is best-suited to single processor machines, because it cannot take advantage of multiprocessor hardware, although it can be useful on multiprocessors for applications with small data sets (up to approximately 100 MB). The serial collector is selected by default on certain hardware and operating system configurations, or can be explicitly enabled with the option  `-XX:+UseSerialGC`.

 - Parallel Garbage Colector:

> The parallel collector (also known as the  _throughput collector_) performs minor collections in parallel, which can significantly reduce garbage collection overhead. It is intended for applications with medium-sized to large-sized data sets that are run on multiprocessor or multithreaded hardware. The parallel collector is selected by default on certain hardware and operating system configurations, or can be explicitly enabled with the option  `-XX:+UseParallelGC`.

 - Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector:

> The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector is designed for applications that prefer shorter garbage collection pauses and that can afford to share processor resources with the garbage collector while the application is running. Typically applications that have a relatively large set of long-lived data (a large tenured generation) and run on machines with two or more processors tend to benefit from the use of this collector. However, this collector should be considered for any application with a low pause time requirement. The CMS collector is enabled with the command-line option  `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`.

 - Garbage-First Garbage Collector:

> The Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector is a server-style garbage collector, targeted for multiprocessor machines with large memories. It attempts to meet garbage collection (GC) pause time goals with high probability while achieving high throughput. Whole-heap operations, such as global marking, are performed concurrently with the application threads. This prevents interruptions proportional to heap or live-data size.  The G1GC is enabled with the command-line option  `-XX:+UseG1GC`.

 - Z Garbage Colector (ZGC):
 
 This garbage colector is only avaiable in JDK 11+, you can use it if you are a advanced user, the current JDK can be downloaded in this [link](https://jdk.java.net/15/).

> The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is a scalable low latency garbage collector. ZGC performs all expensive work concurrently, without stopping the execution of application threads for more than a few milliseconds. It is suitable for applications which require low latency. Pause times are independent of heap size that is being used. ZGC supports heap sizes from 8MB to 16TB. The Z Garbage Collector is enabled with the command-line option  `-XX:+UseZGC`.

 
The line below shows 3 JVM arguments. They are common to all JVM garbage collectors.

```bash
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:ParallelGCThreads=<var> -XX:ConcGCThreads=<var>
```
---

### MaxGCPauseMillis

The time that the garbage colector will take to clear the memory.

> The goal for the maximum pause time.

---

### ParallelGCThreads

There are some criterias for this argument, but for the sake of simplicity put all your  processor's threads until 8.

> The maximum number of threads used for parallel work during garbage collection pauses. This is derived from the number of available threads of the computer that the VM runs on in the following way: if the number of CPU threads available to the process is fewer than or equal to 8, use that. Otherwise add five eighths of the threads greater than to the final number of threads.
> 
> At the start of every pause, the maximum number of threads used is further constrained by maximum total heap size: G1 will not use more than one thread per `-XX:HeapSizePerGCThread` amount of Java heap capacity.

---

### ConcGCThreads

> The maximum number of threads used for concurrent work. By default, this value is `-XX:ParallelGCThreads` divided by 4.

---

## G1GC

Default arguments:

```bash
-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+G1UseAdaptiveIHOP -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=45 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=<var> -XX:G1NewSizePercent=5 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=60 -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=8 -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=85 -XX:-G1EnableStringDeduplication
```

### G1UseAdaptiveIHOP  and InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent

**JRE 1.8.0_261** doesn't surpot it.

> Defaults for controlling the initiating heap occupancy indicate that adaptive determination of that value is turned on, and that for the first few collection cycles G1 will use an occupancy of 45% of the old generation as mark start threshold.

---

### G1HeapRegionSize

> The size of the heap regions. The default value is based on the maximum heap size and it is calculated to render roughly 2048 regions. The size must be a power of 2, and valid values are from 1 to 32 MB.

---

### G1NewSizePercent and G1MaxNewSizePercent
Experimental flag use:

```bash
-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
```

> The size of the young generation in total, which varies between these two values as percentages of the current Java heap in use.

---

### G1MixedGCCountTarget

> The expected length of the space-reclamation phase in a number of collections.

---

### G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent

Experimental flag use:

```bash
-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
```

> Old generation regions with higher live object occupancy than this percentage aren't collected in this space-reclamation phase.

---

### G1EnableStringDeduplication

**JRE 1.8.0_261** doesn't surpot it.

> String deduplication is disabled by default. You can enable it.

---

## CMS

Default arguments:

```bash
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:-CMSIncrementalMode -XX:-CMSIncrementalPacing -XX:CMSIncrementalDutyCycle=10 -XX:CMSIncrementalDutyCycleMin=0 -XX:CMSIncrementalSafetyFactor=10  -XX:CMSIncrementalOffset=0 -XX:CMSExpAvgFactor=25
```

### CMSIncrementalMode 

> Enables incremental mode. Note that the CMS collector must also be enabled (with  `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`) for this option to work.

---

### CMSIncrementalPacing

> Enables automatic pacing. The incremental mode duty cycle is automatically adjusted based on statistics collected while the JVM is running.

---

### CMSIncrementalDutyCycle

> The percentage (0 to 100) of time between minor collections that the CMS collector is allowed to run. If  `CMSIncrementalPacing`  is enabled, then this is just the initial value.

---

### CMSIncrementalDutyCycleMin

> The percentage (0 to 100) that is the lower bound on the duty cycle when  `CMSIncrementalPacing`  is enabled.

---

### CMSIncrementalSafetyFactor

> The percentage (0 to 100) used to add conservatism when computing the duty cycle.

---

### CMSIncrementalOffset

> The percentage (0 to 100) by which the incremental mode duty cycle is shifted to the right within the period between minor collections.

---

### CMSExpAvgFactor

> The percentage (0 to 100) used to weight the current sample when computing exponential averages for the CMS collection statistics.

---
